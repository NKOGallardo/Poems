    <h1>March</h1>
    <h2>🤝A Promise in Every Poem</h2>
    <p>
        With every moon, with every tide,
        A poem for you, my heart confides.
        Each month anew, my words will say,
        The love I feel in a special way.
        
        Through ink and verse, through rhyme and time,
        My love for you will always shine.
        A letter, a line, a whisper so true,
        Every poem, a gift to you.
        
        So here I stand, with words so free,
        A promise to write, for you and me.
        Through every season, near or far,
        My love will live in each stanza's star.
    </p>

    <h1>April</h1>
    <h2>🎀Ink in Shades of Pink</h2>
    <p>
        When words escape, my heart still speaks,
        In poetry’s flow, in soft, warm streaks.
        Like petals caught in April’s breeze,
        You color my world with perfect ease.
        
        I hold a pen, yet it’s you I trace,
        In every rhyme, in every space.
        Soft as pink, yet strong as time,
        A love so pure, so deep, so prime.
        
        Each verse I write, a promise true,
        A piece of me, wrapped up for you.
        So when you read these lines one day,
        Know my heart was inked this way.</p>

    <h1>May</h1>
    <h2>✍Don’t Quit, I’m All Ears
        </h2>
    <p>
        April skies may weigh you down,
        Your smile may hide a quiet frown.
        But in your silence, I still hear,
        A whispered pain, a held-back tear.
        
        You’re tired—I see it in your eyes,
        Still, your spirit always tries.
        But love, don’t carry this alone,
        You’ve got a heart that feels like home.
        
        So if the world feels loud or cold,
        Don’t shut your story, let it unfold.
        I’m not just near—I’m truly here,
        To hold your words, I’m all ears.
        
        No quitting now, not when you shine,
        This storm will pass, like every line.
        And when June comes, with skies so blue,
        A little surprise awaits—for you.
