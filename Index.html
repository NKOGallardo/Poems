    <h1>March</h1>
    <h2>🤝A Promise in Every Poem</h2>
    <p>
        With every moon, with every tide,
        A poem for you, my heart confides.
        Each month anew, my words will say,
        The love I feel in a special way.
        
        Through ink and verse, through rhyme and time,
        My love for you will always shine.
        A letter, a line, a whisper so true,
        Every poem, a gift to you.
        
        So here I stand, with words so free,
        A promise to write, for you and me.
        Through every season, near or far,
        My love will live in each stanza's star.
    </p>

    <h1>April</h1>
    <h2>🎀Ink in Shades of Pink</h2>
    <p>
        When words escape, my heart still speaks,
        In poetry’s flow, in soft, warm streaks.
        Like petals caught in April’s breeze,
        You color my world with perfect ease.
        
        I hold a pen, yet it’s you I trace,
        In every rhyme, in every space.
        Soft as pink, yet strong as time,
        A love so pure, so deep, so prime.
        
        Each verse I write, a promise true,
        A piece of me, wrapped up for you.
        So when you read these lines one day,
        Know my heart was inked this way.</p>

    <h1>May</h1>
    <h2>✍Don’t Quit, I’m All Ears</h2>
    <p>
        April skies may weigh you down,
        Your smile may hide a quiet frown.
        But in your silence, I still hear,
        A whispered pain, a held-back tear.
        
        You’re tired I see it in your eyes,
        Still, your spirit always tries.
        But love, don’t carry this alone,
        You’ve got a heart that feels like home.
        
        So if the world feels loud or cold,
        Don’t shut your story, let it unfold.
        I’m not just near I’m truly here,
        To hold your words, I’m all ears.
        
        No quitting now, not when you shine,
        This storm will pass, like every line.
        And when June comes, with skies so blue,
        A little surprise awaits for you.
        
      </p>
    <h1>June</h1>
    <h2>🧊Even in the Cold</h2>
    <p>
        It’s June, the air is crisp and blue,
        But I still feel the warmth in you.
        Though winter wraps the world in grey,
        My heart for you won’t drift away.

        You’ve carried weight, you’ve walked through rain,
        You’ve smiled through silence, laughed through pain.
        But let this line forever stay:
        I’m proud of you in every way.

        No need to wonder, doubt, or guess,
        In all your more and all your less
        You shine, even when you feel small,
        And I’ll be here through it all.

        As long as breath is in my chest,
        You’ll have someone who knows you’re blessed.
        Through every trial, every climb 
        I’ll stand behind you, every time.
    </p>
     <h1>2025 June 22</h1>
    <h2>“Before We Let Go”</h2>
    <p>
        

I liked your smile, your laugh, your face,
The way you moved with quiet grace.
But deeper love is more than this
It’s more than moments, looks, or bliss.

I thought I knew just what I felt,
But time revealed the cards I dealt.
And though my heart still holds you dear,
The truth is slowly shining clear.

We’re young, still learning right from wrong,
Still finding where our hearts belong.
And love that lasts Jehovah knows
Takes root in more than what first shows.

I read, I prayed, I thought it through,
Not just for me, but also you.
“Am I ready?” the book asked loud,
And I answered with my head unbowed.

So this is not “I’m leaving you”
Because I’ve found somebody new.
It’s just, I want a life that’s blessed,
And right now, closeness needs some rest.

You’re beautiful, just like the verse:
“Fragrance poured, love unrehearsed.”

No hate, no blame, just honest care,
I’ll still look for you in prayer.
And if one day we meet again,
Let it be with hearts that mend.
